</h1>

Ethereum Landing Page (clone) is a project made alongside my course in [B7Web](https://b7web.com.br/fullstack/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI-7eYj5vT-QIVEz6RCh2VfgXQEAAYASAAEgJfifD_BwE&ref=I24108426I) in order to practice HTML and CSS. It's a one page website that copies a few items of the oficial landing page of the Ethereum criptocurrency.

## See Ethereum Landing Page in action

- Download all files and open the [ethereum.html](https://github.com/valmarath/ethereum-landing-page-clone-partial/blob/main/ethereum.html) file on your browser. 

- To test the responsive features, you can use the inspect option to change the dimensions as you please and see how it responds.
